    <h1><strong>Rage, Riot and Revolution</strong></h1>
    <h1>To celebrate DaDa’s 40th Birthday, we are launching our exhibition ‘Rage, Riot and Revolution’ on International Women’s Day, and our project. This exhibition is on display in person at Open Eye Gallery, Liverpool, this March</h1>
    <h1>A series of photographs by <a href="about.html">Jan Williams.</a> Part of the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/6/edit?mid=1982Owdwbe7xfUzgCC3x5mLZkq3m4P5o&usp=sharing">DaDaFest International Art Map.</a></h1>

    <p class="em" style="display: none;">
        This exhibition celebrates their resilience, ingenuity, and impact. Through photography, we illuminate their stories as activists fighting for equal rights, as artists reshaping cultural narratives, and as leaders in our communities.</a></p>
    <p class="em" style="display: none;">
        The North West has long been a place for grassroots movements, and disabled women have played a pivotal role in shaping this history. At the heart of this work lies disability culture: a celebration of identity, creativity, and community rooted in the lived experiences of disabled people. Through art, activism, and leadership, these women have amplified their voices, challenged societal norms, and reshaped policies that impact millions. They have rejected the narrative and representation of disability as being negative, and instead embraced it as a source of strength, innovation, and belonging.</a></p>
    <p class="em" style="display: none;">
        “It is the systems that continue to disempower and disable us, not us.” - Zoe Partington, Chief Executive, DaDa</a></p>
    <p class="em" style="display: none;">
        Many of these women have engaged in global networks, influencing policy, art, and activism worldwide.</a></p>
    <p class="em" style="display: none;">
        As you explore these photographs and stories, consider the barriers they’ve dismantled and the futures they’ve created to ensure we embrace difference. Their passion, drive and work invite us to reimagine how we perceive ‘disability’ and difference — not to be seen as pitying, medical or charitable, but as a source of unique perspectives, strength and innovation.</a></p>
    <p class="em" style="display: none;">
        The photographs in this exhibition honour their stories, capturing the resilience, creativity, and vision that have driven profound social and cultural change. They invite you to reflect on how these leaders have not only shaped policy and culture but also built a legacy of empowerment that continues to transform lives. Their influence extends far beyond Liverpool — fuelling international movements for disability justice and inclusion, inspiring a global audience to see disability not as a barrier, but as a powerful perspective.</a></p>
    <p class="em" style="display: none;">
        This is more than a celebration — it’s a call to action. By embracing the values of disability culture, we can all contribute to a more equitable, inclusive future where diverse voices lead the way.</a></p>
