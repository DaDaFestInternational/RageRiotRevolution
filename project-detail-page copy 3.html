                <h1>Ruth Fabby MBE</h1>
                <p>“I chose the Bluecoat as it is where my arts journey began, aged 14. I undertook a photography course at secondary school, focusing on composition and developing pictures in a dark room and won an award which was presented at the Bluecoat. It was the first time I had been into the building, and I became hooked.</p>
                <p>In the early 80s, whilst training in performance theatre at Liverpool Theatre School (the Bluecoat was often used for my Guildhall and LAMDA exams), I participated in many dance and movement performances and workshops based there, including artists like Maedee Dupres, Peta Lily, & David Glass. I even worked in the cafe part-time.</p>
                <p>In the 90s, I was in involved in many arts activities and was invited to be a board member, then Vice Chair. It was opportune to help focus on making the building more accessible.</p>
                <p>In 2008, DaDa moved into the building, continuing the tradition to collaborate on wonderful arts events and exhibitions at a greater level, something that would not have been possible a few years before. The Bluecoat is my ’heART in Liverpool’.”</p>
