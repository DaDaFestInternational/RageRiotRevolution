            <h1>About the Artist: Jan Williams, The Caravan Gallery</h1>
            <img src="images/Jan Williams - image by Chris Teasdale.jpg" height=400px width=max style=float:left alt="Jan stands, with her arms folded, in front of her garden full of plants and a gravel path. She is a mature woman with short white blonde hair and one gold hoop earring, wearing a black jacket with red zips, and striped green trousers">
			<p>The portraits in this exhibition (apart from the one provided by Mandy Colleran) are by Birkenhead-born artist and photographer Jan Williams, co-founder of itinerant arts venue The Caravan Gallery with partner Chris Teasdale. The Caravan Gallery ethos is about breaking down barriers and engaging with people, places and themes that are often overlooked and under-celebrated. It’s about documenting the ‘reality and surreality of everyday life’ and creating participatory exhibitions about people and places.</p>
            <p>“I’ve really appreciated the opportunity to work with DaDa. It’s been an absolute joy and privilege to meet and photograph so many incredibly impressive women artists and activists to celebrate DaDaFest International’s 40th anniversary. Although Rage undoubtedly provides the motivation required to face challenges and fight injustice, everyone I photographed exuded joy and chose to focus on positivity and the power of creativity. I heard so much about the camaraderie and mutual support between deaf and disabled artists and activists. I also learned about the Social Model of Disability which says that people are disabled by barriers in society, not by their impairment or difference. In other words, it’s society that needs to change! I hope my photographs convey a sense of joy, fun, colour, mischief, power, determination and a spirit of playfulness and rebellion.</p>
            <p>Big thanks to all the fabulous artists and activists for sharing their stories, to their PAs and assistants, to the DaDa team, Open Eye, and to everyone who enabled this project to happen.</p>
            <p>Thanks to my assistant Chris Teasdale, and to my Mum, Pat Williams (Mayor of Wirral 2002-3), for her ongoing inspiration and support.”</p>
